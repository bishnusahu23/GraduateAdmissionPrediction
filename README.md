#### We developed a predictive regression model using an artificial neural network (ANN) to forecast graduate admission chances. This model assists students in identifying universities that align well with their profiles, offering a realistic assessment of their admission probabilities. The predicted outcomes provide students with valuable insights to make informed decisions about their university applications.
